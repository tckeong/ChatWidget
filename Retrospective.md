## First question

-   If I had two extra weeks, I want to complete all the requirements, following are the requirements and the problems remains:

1. The robustness of websocket.
2. The coverage of the test cases.
3. Multi-agent system.
4. Shows the unread messages.
5. Community Broadcast.
6. Add additional properties (name) to the prisma.
7. Add the CI pipeline.

-   Add the features to show whether the user has read the messages or not.
-   Add the feature to show the attachment of the messages.

## Second question

The biggest trade-off I made during development was allocating a significant amount of time and effort to mastering the backend framework (Fastify) and meticulously integrating the Prisma database structure, which consequently limited the time available for refining the frontend UI and implementing all features. I spent too much time to getting familiar to fastify.
