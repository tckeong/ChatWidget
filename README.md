## 🚀 Local Development Setup

To get the entire application running on your local machine using Docker Compose:

### Prerequisites

-   **Git**: For cloning the repository.
-   **Node.js** (v22 LTS recommended): Required for `npm` and running frontend/backend scripts.
-   **Docker Desktop**: Includes Docker Engine and Docker Compose. Ensure it's running.

## Requirements:

-   Need to setup the Postgresql database and Redis first.
-   The user credential can be found in server/.env

## Deploy the projects

-   For the frontend, run

```bash
npm run dev
```

-   For the backend, run

```bash
npm run build
npm run dev

npm run test # for running test
```

-   In docker, can just run

```bash
docker compose up
```
